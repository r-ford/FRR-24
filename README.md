This repository contains the code used to generate the figures in Ford et al. (2024) in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

There are three notebooks:
- `nonfeedback-figures`, which recreates Figs. 1-4 and 7-10
- `feedback-figures`, which recreates Figs. 5 and 6
- `kernel-feedback-analysis`, which performs a feedback analysis using radiative kernels that is used in the `feedback-figures` notebook

The data used in these notebooks is stored on a UAlbany server. While the data is not publicly accessible at the moment, this repository will be updated when it is made avaiable.
